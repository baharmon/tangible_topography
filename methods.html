<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
We have conducted a rigorous experiment using geospatial analytics
to compare spatial performance in analog modeling by
hand, in tangible computing using Tangible Landscape, and
in visual computing using 3D modeling programs via a GUI.
Tangible Landscape is a continuous shape display tightly integrated
with GRASS GIS that was designed to intuitively 3D
sketch landscapes. Conceptually, Tangible Landscape
couples a physical model with a digital model in a
real-time feedback cycle of 3D scanning, geospatial modeling
and simulation, and projection.
We tested our hypotheses using quantitative and qualitative
methods. We studied applied spatial cognitive processes using the
metrics and parameters of the given application. We studied
how participants perform in a series of time constrained terrain
modeling exercises using analog modeling, visual computing,
and tangible computing. We assessed their
performance with each technology using spatial statistics, topographic
parameters, morphology, process-form interactions,
and differencing. We used a fast, fluid, iterative process as a proxy
for creative thinking that can be assessed using these methods.

<h5>Terrain modeling experiment</h5>

<p>
The 1st exercise tests spatial performance in analog modeling
to establish the baseline spatial ability of each participant. In
this exercise participants sculpt a given terrain in polymeric
sand using their hands with a CNC routed model for reference.
The 2nd exercise tests spatial performance in projection augmented
analog modeling to establish a baseline for spatial
performance in tangible computing. In this exercise participants
sculpt a given terrain in polymeric sand using a projected
map of the given elevation and contours as a guide.
The 3rd-5th exercises test spatial performance in tangible computing
augmented with different analytics. In the 3rd exercise
participants use Tangible Landscape to sculpt a given terrain
in polymeric sand using the given and scanned contours as a
guide. In the 4th exercise participants use Tangible Landscape
to sculpt a given terrain in polymeric sand using the difference
between the given and the scanned landscape as a guide. In
the 5th exercise participants use Tangible Landscape to sculpt
a given terrain in polymeric sand using the simulated water
flow over the scanned landscape as a guide in order to study
4D thinking. The 6th and 7th exercises test spatial performance in visual
computing. In the 6th exercise participants digitally sculpt a
given terrain in Rhinoceros, a 3D modeling program, using the
given 3D contours as a guide. In the 7th exercise participants
digitally sculpt a given terrain in VUE, a 3D modeling program
designed for intuitive terrain sculpting, with a CNC routed
model for reference.

<h5>Data collection and analysis</h5>

<p>
In the 1st-5th exercises the resulting physical models are 3D
scanned, imported into GRASS GIS as point clouds, and interpolated
as DEMs for analysis. In the 6th and 7th exercises the
resulting digital models are exported as point clouds, imported
into GRASS GIS, and interpolated as DEMs for analysis. For
each model I compute the elevation and its histogram and bivariate
scatterplot, the slope, the difference and its histogram,
the simulated water flow, and morphology. For each exercise
I compute a map of the coefficient of variance of all the of
DEMs, bivariate scatterplots of the covariance and correlation
matrix of all the of DEMs, and the mean and the absolute
value of the mean of the differences between the the reference
terrain and the modeled terrain.
</p>

<p>
During the experiment the participants creative processes were
observed and documented with photographs and notes. Semistructured
interviews were conducted with select participants
after the experiment. The interviews were focused on the
intuitiveness and affordances of each technology, strategies
and modes of representation, participantsâ€™ understanding of
space in a given medium, and their creative process.
