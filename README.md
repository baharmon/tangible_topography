# Embodied Spatial Cognition in Tangible Computing
An experimental study of 3D spatial performance using tangible interfaces for GIS.

This repository contains python scripts for reproducing the experiment in [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/)
and a LaTeX paper describing the experiment.

GIS data for the experiment, the results of the experiment, and instructions for reproducing the experiment are available at [osf.io/82gst/](https://osf.io/82gst/).
