# Embodied Spatial Cognition in Tangible Computing
An experimental study of 3D spatial performance using tangible interfaces for GIS.

This repository contains python scripts for reproducing the experiment in [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/)
and a LaTeX paper describing the experiment.

GIS data for the experiment, the results of the experiment, and instructions for reproducing the experiment are available at [osf.io/82gst/](https://osf.io/82gst/).

# TODO

## Literature review
* Detailed discussion of related work
- Evaluate other systems
- Compare similar systems to TL
* Discuss relevant user studies
* Research questions
- What functionality is needed for expert modeling tasks?

## Concept
* Frame as an expert system
- vs. AR Sandbox as novice system

## Implementation
* Describe system implementation in greater detail
* Physical dimensions
- Diagram of system with dimensions
* Capturing distance
- Precision
- Scanning res in x, y, z
- Noise
* Sampling rate
- Filtering
* Lag
- Lag due to analyses
- Table of analyses with speed benchmarks
- Discussion of frame rate and interaction
- Tradeoffs

## Analysis and results
* ~~Rerun and render analyses~~

## Appendices
* Add mapsets, renderings, photographs, and video as supplemental material
