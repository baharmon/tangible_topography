\section{Introduction}

We have designed Tangible Landscape -- a tangible interface powered by a geographic information system (GIS) -- 
that gives spatial data an interactive, physical form so that users can naturally feel it, see it, and shape it.
%
Our aim was to iteratively design and empirically test a tangible interface that augments spatial thinking and improves spatial performance. 
%
Spatial thinking can be embodied -- people can functionally think about space with their bodies by cognitively grasping objects and physically simulating it \cite{Kirsh2013}.
%
Theoretically tangible interfaces should improve spatial performance through embodied cognition by enabling natural modes of interaction \cite{Dourish2001}, offloading cognitive processes onto the body \cite{Kirsh2013}, and computationally augmenting spatial thinking \cite{Dror2008}. 
%
We designed Tangible Landscape to physically manifest digital data so that users can cognitively grasp the data as an extension of their bodies and automatically, immediately, and subconsciously interact with it. 
%
We conducted a series of experiments using quantitative methods including geospatial modeling, analysis, simulation, and statistics and qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews and direct observation
to test whether tangible interfaces can improve spatial performance. 
%
We also explored how users approached spatial problem solving using Tangible Landscape in a serious gaming event.

\subsection{Spatial thinking}

Spatial thinking -- `the mental processes of representing, analyzing, and drawing inferences from spatial relations' \cite{Uttal2013} -- is used pervasively in everyday life % at a personal scale 
for tasks like recognizing things, manipulating things, interacting with others, and way-finding. 
%
Spatial thinking is also used extensively in science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math 
for tasks like 
simulating physical processes,
mapping and manipulating molecules,
designing circuits, 
designing buildings, 
shaping sculpture,
and studying topology. 
%
Given the importance of spatial thinking -- personally, academically, and professionally -- %how can we improve it? 
how can we effectively improve our spatial performance, our ability to perform tasks that require spatial thinking? 
% how can spatial performance, our ability to perform tasks that require spatial thinking, effectively be improved?

Many spatial tasks can be performed computationally 
enabling us to efficiently store, model, and analyze large sets of spatial data 
and solve complex spatiotemporal problems.
%
In engineering, design, and the arts 
computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D modeling software are used to interactively, computationally model, analyze, and animate complex spatial forms. 
%
In scientific computing spatial patterns and processes can be mathematically modeled, simulated, and optimized. 
%
Geographic information systems, for example, can be used to computationally store, model, analyze, simulate, and represent geospatial patterns and processes. 
%
The open source project GRASS GIS for example supports 
`geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps production, spatial modeling, and visualization' \cite{GRASS}.

Computing mediates and transforms spatial thinking, expanding, but also constraining what is possible.
%
While spatial computing can augment spatial thinking 
-- distributing or offloading cognitive processes through digital computation -- 
the logic of implementation,
the limits of what is computationally possible, 
and the modes of input and output
constrain how we reason. % citations
%
Furthermore, 
when it is difficult to interact with a computer, 
to input commands and parse the resulting output, 
one has to think harder and risks frustration and demotivation. % citations

%Furthermore, 
%difficulty in interacting with a computer
%-- in inputing commands and parsing the resulting output --
%can add cognitive costs, generate frustration, and sap motivation. 

Unintuitive modes of human-computer interaction constrain how we think and add cognitive and emotional costs. 
%
The paradigmatic modes for interacting with computers today 
-- command line interfaces (CLI) and
graphical user interfaces (GUI)
%including touch interfaces
 -- 
require physical input from devices like mice, keyboards, digitizing pens, and touch screens, but

Imagine sculpting a volume in a 3D modeling program.

When sculpting a volume

There is a disconnect between intention, action, and feedback when one imagines a change, clicks with a mouse, and then sees the change on a display.

%Embodied spatial thinking may lead to improvements in STEM performance by reducing cognitive loads with pragmatic representations and physical simulation and by enhancing perception with visual and haptic feedback.

\subsection{Coupling experiment}

%Psychometric tests of spatial ability -- the application of spatial thinking -- for example study spatial visualization and mental rotation \citep{Uttal2013,Uttal2013a,Ormand2014}.
%We, however, do not just see space -- we also feel it; we use our bodies to feel size, shape, and volume. 
%Space need not be imagined to be transformed -- haptic feedback about space informs subconscious pragmatic representations that rapidly generate action \citep{Jeannerod1997}. Spatial thinking can be embodied.
