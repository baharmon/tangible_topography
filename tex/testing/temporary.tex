role of embodied cognition 
in tangible interaction

cite lack of empirical studies on shape displays











conceptually
3D spatial thinking is complex / high level

but perhaps it can be understood intuitively 
with embodied cognition



Tangible interfaces can
for example
significantly improve 
spatial performance over graphical interfaces 
for tasks like matching 2D and 3D representations \cite{Cuendet2012}.


%Advances in sensing technologies 
%have made it possible to capture 3D data 
%at millimeter to global scales.


in terms of physics and philosophy
space
can be either positional (relative) or a container (absolute)




%Given that embodiment is inherently spatial, 
%how do tangibles mediate spatial cognition and performance? 

%While some of these questions are on the research agendas of
%conferences like the ACM International Conference on 
%Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction\ldots

%A more human-centered approach 
%critically questions, reimagines, and then explores 
%what technology can do for us.
%-- `it's about reimagining, and then acting out, a better world'
%\cite{Bannon2011}.

%Of course we need to develop the technologies 
%and design prototypes 
%before we can study some of these questions.
%But studying these questions % user research 
%is also an important part of the design process
%-- understanding how our systems work helps us to refine them.

—spatial visualization and spatial orientation—or whether a third—spatial
relations—is also a fundamental dimension of spatial ability (Lohman, 1979; Gilmartin &
Patton, 1984; Golledge & Stimson, 1997; Montello et al., 1999). Spatial visualization is
the ability to mentally manipulate, rotate, twist or invert pictorially presented visual
stimuli. Spatial orientation involves the comprehension of the arrangement of elements
within a visual stimulus pattern, the aptitude for remaining unconfused by the changing
orientations in which a configuration may be presented and the ability to determine spatial
relations in which the body orientation of the observer is an essential part of the problem
184 J. Lee & R. Bednarz
(McGee, 1979). The dimension that is the least clearly defined, and the most contentious,
is spatial relations.
Spatial relations include abilities to recognize spatial distributions and spatial patterns,
to connect locations, to associate and correlate spatially distributed phenomena, to
comprehend and use spatial hierarchies, to regionalize, to orientate to real-world
frames of reference, to imagine maps from verbal descriptions, to sketch map, to
compare maps, and to overlay and dissolve maps. (Golledge & Stimson, 1997, p. 158)

Spatial Skills Test
Psychometric tests have been used extensively to assess spatial abilities, especially spatial
visualization and spatial orientation (e.g. Kail et al., 1979; McGlone, 1981; Miller &
Santoni, 1986; Goldstein et al., 1990; Newcombe & Dubas, 1992). ‘Spatial’ in the
psychometric tests, however, refers to small-scale (table-top) space which is not the scale
most pertinent to geography. Furthermore, psychometric tests hardly assess the ‘spatial
relations’ dimension, which is most closely related to GIS activities (Self et al., 1992;
Golledge, 1993; Lee & Bednarz, 2004). Montello et al. and Golledge argued that:
[T]he restricted definition of spatial ability, as incorporated into many psychometric
tests, contrasts with the richness of the general literature on spatial activities and
spatial behavior, much of it from disciplines other than psychology. (Montello et al.,
1999, p. 517)
[Spatial knowledge] includes higher level concepts such as hierarchy, surface,
association, connectivity, pattern, and so on ... Psychologists have neglected height

or relief in their examination of spatial phenomena. In contrast, the geographer
commonly represents spatial interactions, movements, or even the basic distribution
or pattern of phenomena as surfaces. They are sometimes represented in two
dimensional form and sometimes represented as three dimensional surfaces.
(Golledge, 1993, p. 28)
Considering that GIS has been developed to deal with spatial information at the
geographic scale, psychometric tests suffer obvious limitations for measuring the effects
of GIS learning on spatial ability (Golledge, 1993; Mark & Freundschuh, 1995).

Spatial abilities are cognitive skills fundamental to spatial thinking, being composed of spatial
visualization, spatial orientation, and spatial relation [5]
[GOLLEDGE 1997)

. A variety of psychological studies have
developed and used tests for measuring spatial abilities [6,7]. Since most of them are paper-and-pencil
tests in small-scale space, they are not necessarily applicable to spatial thinking in large-scale geographic
space. Hegarty and Waller [7], who reviewed previous studies on spatial abilities, found very little
correlation between large- and small-scale spatial abilities.
