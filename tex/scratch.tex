enabling natural modes of interaction, 
offloading cognitive processes onto the body, 
and computationally augmenting spatial thinking.

Theoretically tangible interfaces 
should enhance spatial thinking 
by embodying cognition so that 
interaction is natural and intuitive,
cognitive processes are offloaded onto the body,
and cognitive processes are computationally augmented.


\subsection{Embodied spatial cognition}
% what is spatial thinking?



% definition
\citeauthor{Uttal2013} defined spatial thinking as 
`the mental processes of representing, analyzing, and drawing inferences from spatial relations' \citeyearpar{Uttal2013}. 


Psychometric tests of spatial ability -- the application of spatial thinking -- for example study spatial visualization and mental rotation \citep{Uttal2013,Uttal2013a,Ormand2014}.

We, however, do not just see space -- we also feel it; we use our bodies to feel size, shape, and volume. 
Space need not be imagined to be transformed -- haptic feedback about space informs subconscious pragmatic representations that rapidly generate action \citep{Jeannerod1997}. Spatial thinking can be embodied.

% learning about space
Spatial thinking is malleable and can be improved with training. 
The effects of spatial training can be durable -- persisting for months -- and transferable -- training in a given spatial task improves performance in other untrained spatial tasks \citep{Uttal2013}. 
% STEM
Spatial training has been shown to improve performance in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
% performance
Research, however, is needed to determine which training methods will mostly effectively improve STEM performance. 
How can spatial training integrate domain specific knowledge? And could such applied training more effectively improve performance in a given discipline? \citep{Uttal2013} 


% embodied cognition
Embodied cognition highlights the importance of a kinaesthetic, pragmatic understanding of space
and the enaction of spatial transformation -- for the act of transforming an object changes how we think about space. 
As Kirsh argues, sometimes `we know more by doing than by seeing' \citeyearpar{Kirsh2013}.

% embodiment in STEM
Embodied spatial thinking may lead to improvements in STEM performance by reducing cognitive loads with pragmatic representations and physical simulation and by enhancing perception with visual and haptic feedback. 

% embodiment in STEAM
Since spatial thinking is mediated by technology the effectiveness of training methods will depend upon their implementation, upon the technology used. 
Computer gaming has been shown to improve spatial thinking and technologies like geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to integrate domain specific knowledge \citep{Uttal2013}.
Unintuitive human-computer interaction, however, may constrain spatial thinking and add cognitive costs thus reducing the effectiveness of digitally implemented training methods. 
Embodied and computationally enriched cognition may enhance spatial thinking in novel ways
enabling and encouraging coupled creative and analytic thinking.

Spatial thinking can be learned; it is malleable and can be improved with experience and training. 
Spatial training has been shown to improve performance in science, technology, engineering, and math. 
It can be transferable, improving performance in other untrained spatial tasks. 
Research, however, is needed to determine which training methods will mostly effectively improve spatial thinking. 
How can spatial training integrate domain specific knowledge? And could such applied training more effectively improve performance in a given discipline? \cite{Uttal2013} 

The effectiveness of any training method will depend upon its implementation, upon the technology used. 
Computer gaming for example has been shown to improve general spatial thinking, while technologies like geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to integrate domain specific knowledge \cite{Uttal2013}.
Unintuitive human-computer interaction, however, may constrain spatial thinking and add cognitive costs that reduce the effectiveness of digitally implemented training methods.

% importance in science, technology, education, and math

Spatial thinking is also used extensively in science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math. 
Physicists use it to simulate physical processes,
biologists and chemists use it to map and manipulate molecules,
electrical engineers use it to design circuits, 
architects use it to design buildings, 
sculptors use it to shape forms, 
and mathematicians use it to study topology. \\

Spatial relationships, patterns, forms, and processes can be computationally modeled, analyzed, simulated, and represented. 

Space is often modeled, analyzed, simulated, and represented computationally at geographic scales
due of the sheer quantity and complexity of data. 
Computational models can process large sets of spatial data and model or simulate complex spatiotemporal processes.


Due to their complexity spatial relationships, patterns, forms, and processes are often computationally modeled, analyzed, simulated, and represented.

% Theory

% Embodied cognition

Cognition can be embodied -- it can be embedded in the body and based on bodily experience. 
Higher cognitive processes, the traditional realm of cognitive science, 
can rely on lower level processes such as emotion and sensorimotor processes that link perception and action. 
Thus feeling, action, and perception can be functionally integral to thought \cite{Hardy-Vallee2008}. 
We can for example physically simulate cognitive processes, offloading cognition onto action to functionally `think with our bodies' \cite{Kirsh2013}. 
We can cognitively grasp objects, temporarily, contingently incorporating tools into our body schema \cite{Kirsh2013}.


% Spatial cognition
Many conceptions and studies of spatial thinking focus on a visual, semantic understanding of space. 
Embodied cognition, however, highlights the importance of a kinaesthetic, pragmatic understanding of space
and the enaction of spatial transformation -- for the act of transforming an object changes how we think about space. 
As \cite{Kirsh2013} argues, sometimes `we know more by doing than by seeing' \cite{Kirsh2013}.


\cite{Uttal2013} defined spatial thinking as 
`the mental processes of representing, analyzing, and drawing inferences from spatial relations' \cite{Uttal2013}. 
This definition is based on a semantic rather than pragmatic understanding of space, an understanding based on visual rather haptic, kinaesthetic feedback. 
In this paradigm space is imagined rather than felt and spatial transformation is imagined rather than enacted. 
Psychometric tests of spatial ability -- the application of spatial thinking -- for example study spatial visualization and mental rotation \cite{Uttal2013,Uttal2013a,Ormand2014}.
We, however, do not just see space -- we also feel it; we use our bodies to feel size, shape, and volume. 
Space need not be imagined to be transformed -- haptic feedback about space informs subconscious pragmatic representations that rapidly generate action \cite{Jeannerod1997}. Spatial thinking can be embodied.

Embodied spatial thinking may lead to improvements in performance by reducing cognitive loads with pragmatic representations and physical simulation and by enhancing perception with visual and haptic feedback.

% Digital disembodiment

% Tangible interfaces (to embody spatial cognition) (affordance, feedback, intuition)
Tangible computing aims to embody computing 
by coupling physical and digital data \cite{Dourish2001} -- 
by physically manifesting digital data so that we can cognitively grasp and absorb it,
so that we can think with it rather than about it \cite{Kirsh2013}. 
\cite{Ishii1997} envisioned that TUIs would  `take advantage of natural physical affordances to achieve a heightened legibility and seamlessness of interaction between people and information' \cite{Ishii1997}. 

To understand how computing transforms cognition we need to study
`the complex coordination between external and internal simulation, between doing things internally and doing things externally' \cite{Kirsh2013}. % Research question!

% A brief history of tangible computing?

Theoretically tangible interaction should offload cognitive processes through bodily action, physical simulation, and digital computation.

Should improve spatial performance.

Research questions: 
Can tangible interfaces improve spatial performance?
Which tangible analytics improve spatial performance the most?

Aim: Improve spatial performance

A comparative study of 3D spatial performance with hand modeling, digital modeling, and tangible interaction.

% tangibles and embodiment

Theoretically tangible interfaces that physically manifest digital data should enable users to cognitively grasp the data as an extension of their bodies so that they can automatically, immediately, and subconsciously interact with it. 


When thinking with the body, when embodying cognition, one can physically simulate cognitive processes and cognitively grasp objects, temporarily, contingently incorporating tools into our body schema \cite{Kirsh2013}.

We designed Tangible Landscape so that spatial cognition can be embodied -- embedded in the body and based on bodily experience -- so that users can kinaesthetically understand and shape space

By making GIS more intuitive and accessible for beginners, empowers geospatial experts, and creates new exciting opportunities for developers - like gaming with GIS. 


TUIs make pragmatic representations of digital data. 
Pragmatic representations are conceptual models for rapidly generating action
that are primarily based on tactile feedback and are processed automatically, immediately, 
and subconsciously \cite{Jeannerod1997}. 
%

By physically manifesting data so that we can pragmatically
interact with computations,  
TUIs should enable rapid, intuitive action and expression 
in a way that was not possible in visual computing. 

By enabling embodied cognition in human-computer interaction 
TUIs should let us cognitively grip data as an extension of our bodies, 
intuitively manipulate data, and physically simulate processes.
