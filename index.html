<h3>Embodied Spatial Thinking in Tangible Computing</h3>

<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p>Tangible user interfaces are based on the premise that embodied
cognition in computing can enhance cognitive processes.
However, the ways in which embodied cognition in computing
transform spatial thinking have not yet been rigorously studied.
As we continue to design and develop Tangible Landscape – a continuous
shape display powered by a geographic information system –
we are using it to explore how technology mediates creativity and
spatial cognition in an experiment. 
In this terrain modeling experiment we use geospatial analytics
supplemented by semi-structured interviews and direct observation
to analyze how visual computing with a GUI and
tangible computing with a shape display mediate multidimensional
spatial performance.
</p>

<h5>Testable hypotheses</h5>
<p>We hypothesize that:
<ol>
<li> limited feedback constrains spatial performance, </li>
<li> illusions can lead to the misinterpretation of 3D space in
visual computing reducing spatial performance, </li>
<li> computational analytics like differencing and flow simulations
can enhance spatial performance, </li>
<li> computationally enriched analytical thinking can be coordinated
with embodied thinking, </li>
<li> tangible computing that computationally enhances embodied
spatial thinking can improve spatial performance, and </li>
<li> tangible computing can enable a rapid iterative process
of exploratory, generative form-finding that can improve
spatial performance. </li>
</ol>
